        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose fllour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring

            is
            smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
