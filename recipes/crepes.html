        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that
            everyone has on hand.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring
            to
            combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
            using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the
            surface evenly.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the
            other side. Serve hot.</p>
